Task 3 - DESIGN A MULTI-CLOUD ARCHITECTURE WHERE SERVICES ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS TWO CLOUD PROVIDERS.

Objectives:

1.High Availability: Ensure continuous service availability by distributing resources across providers.

2.Scalability: Enable dynamic scaling of resources to handle varying workloads.

3.Disaster Recovery: Minimize downtime with redundancy across different cloud providers.

4.Vendor Independence: Avoid reliance on a single vendor, reducing risks of outages or pricing changes.

5.Cost Optimization: Utilize the most cost-effective solutions from each provider.

6.Compliance and Security: Meet regulatory and security requirements through multi-layered security models.

Key points:

1.Service Distribution

Frontend Hosting:

AWS S3 for static content (HTML, CSS, JS) with CloudFront for CDN.

Azure Blob Storage with Azure CDN as a backup.

Backend Services:

AWS Lambda (serverless computing) for dynamic processing.

Azure Functions as a backup or additional processing services.

2. Database Management

AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) as the primary database.

Azure SQL Database as the failover or secondary database.

Synchronization tools (e.g., AWS Database Migration Service or Azure Data Factory) for replication.

3. Load Balancing and Traffic Management

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across AWS instances.

Azure Traffic Manager to route traffic between AWS and Azure regions based on performance and availability.

Conclusion:

This multi-cloud architecture design demonstrates how to strategically distribute services across AWS and Azure to achieve high availability, scalability, and security. By integrating services from multiple providers, organizations can optimize costs, enhance performance, and mitigate risks. As cloud technologies evolve, multi-cloud approaches will continue to be a vital strategy for resilient and future-proof IT infrastructures.
